          <h3>Our President set on the road to figure out the easiest, most cost effective, way to ease Floorplan audits for dealerships without physical, human interaction.</h3>
          <br/>
          <h3>A mutual friend had explained the process of the audits and felt there had to be a way to solve the problem with technology.</h3>
          <br/>
          <h3>Dealerships have to reconcile the bankâ€™s reports from their own by touching every car to verify the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN).</h3>
          <br/>
          <h3>Cars were often not where they were supposed to be, on a test drive, and in a few cases actually completely missing.</h3>
          <br/>
          <h3>Leveraging 35 years of experience in high tech, Mario quickly determined the key to resolving the problem would be low, non-intrusive cost to the vehicle, and simple to install and use. Leverage the OBD-II port of the vehicles and combining it with his patented solution opened the door to much more functionality and made VINBeam what it is today.</h3>
